# TSC Meeting Notes

Agendas, minutes, and action items from Technical Steering Committee 
meetings supporting interoperable learning data infrastructure.

## Structure

Meeting notes are organized by date:

- `YYYY-MM-DD-agenda.md` — Pre-meeting agenda
- `YYYY-MM-DD-minutes.md` — Meeting minutes and decisions
- `YYYY-MM-DD-actions.md` — Action items and owners

## Participation

The TSC is structured as a non-hierarchical body with all members 
participating on equal footing. Meeting notes are published publicly 
to ensure transparency and accountability.

## Heritage Acknowledgment

The work of this committee builds upon foundations established by 
the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative, a program of 
the U.S. Department of Defense, funded by the American taxpayer.
